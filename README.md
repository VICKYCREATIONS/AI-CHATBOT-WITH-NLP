This Python code implements a simple AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the `nltk` library. It defines a set of predefined conversation patterns using regular expressions and responses, allowing the chatbot to respond to user inputs. Instead of interactive user input (`input()`), the chatbot processes a list of predefined messages, making it suitable for non-interactive environments. The `get_response()` function matches user queries with predefined patterns, while `chat_from_script()` processes a sequence of user inputs and returns responses. The script runs a test case with sample inputs such as greetings, asking for the chatbotâ€™s name, and saying goodbye.

OUTPUT:

AI Chatbot: Hi there! What can I do for you?

AI Chatbot: I am an AI chatbot. You can call me ChatGPT!

AI Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm here to help you!

AI Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day ahead!
